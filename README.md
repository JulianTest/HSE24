Not using database due to time => Would have used Room

UI is horrible, but I didn't spend any time on it

Removing from basket only works from ProductDetails (can be reached from Basket View)

No Bottom Navigation / Fragments etc to safe some time.

My IDE is currently not configured completely, so sadly no autoformat => Code should be rearranged

no Unit tests, although I would start with the transformation of the Categories, that seems error prone

I didn't create seperate Files and Folders for everything, to reduce some boilerplate code, the concept should be clear anyway
